## Zhutao Zhuang 

Hi, I am currently working as a software engineer at Microsoft at Suzhou.  
My research interests focus on machine learning for system, system for machine learning 
and cloud.  
My current research work applies machine learning algorithm to storage engine to make better 
decisions.
My goal is to build intelligent system that can leverage the power of data to solve 
problems that are hard to solve well by traditional algorithm.

My practice philosophy follows learn-teach-apply triangle.
