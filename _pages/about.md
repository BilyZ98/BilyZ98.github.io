Hi, I am currently working as a software engineer at Microsoft at Suzhou.  

**Research interests**
- Machine learning for system
- System for machine learning
- Cloud
<!-- My research interests focus on machine learning for system, system for machine learning  -->
<!-- and cloud.   -->

My goal is to build intelligent system that can leverage the power of data to solve 
problems that are hard to solve well by traditional algorithm.

My practice philosophy follows learn-teach-apply triangle.
