`calloc` and `malloc` are both functions in C used for dynamic memory allocation, but they have some key differences.

### `calloc`

`calloc` stands for "contiguous allocation." It allocates memory for an array of elements, initializes all bytes to zero, and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.

**Syntax**:
```c
void *calloc(size_t num, size_t size);
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `num`: Number of elements.
  - `size`: Size of each element.

### `malloc`

`malloc` stands for "memory allocation." It allocates a specified number of bytes of memory and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. However, it does not initialize the memory.

**Syntax**:
```c
void *malloc(size_t size);
```

- **Parameter**:
  - `size`: Number of bytes to allocate.

### Key Differences

1. **Initialization**:
   - `calloc`: Initializes the allocated memory to zero.
   - `malloc`: Does not initialize the allocated memory; it contains garbage values.

2. **Parameters**:
   - `calloc`: Takes two parameters (number of elements and size of each element).
   - `malloc`: Takes one parameter (total number of bytes to allocate).

3. **Usage**:
   - `calloc` is useful when you need an array of elements initialized to zero.
   - `malloc` is useful when you need a block of memory without initialization.

### Example

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

```c
// Using calloc
int *arr1 = (int *)calloc(5, sizeof(int)); // Allocates memory for 5 integers and initializes them to 0

// Using malloc
int *arr2 = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // Allocates memory for 5 integers, but they contain garbage values
```
