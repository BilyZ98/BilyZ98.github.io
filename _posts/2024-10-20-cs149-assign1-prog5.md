Extra Credit: (1 point) Note that the total memory bandwidth consumed computation in main.cpp is TOTAL_BYTES = 4 * N * sizeof(float);. Even though saxpy loads one element from X, one element from Y, and writes one element to result the multiplier by 4 is correct. Why is this the case? (Hint, think about how CPU caches work.)

Answer:
It's because saxpy fetch 4 vector variables through the memory.
```cpp
void saxpySerial(int N,
                       float scale,
                       float X[],
                       float Y[],
                       float result[])
{

    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {
        result[i] = scale * X[i] + Y[i];
    }
}

```


Extra Credit: (points handled on a case-by-case basis) Improve the performance of saxpy. We're looking for a significant speedup here, not just a few percentage points. If successful, describe how you did it and what a best-possible implementation on these systems might achieve. Also, if successful, come tell the staff, we'll be interested. ;-)

Answer: 
I don't know how to do that.
