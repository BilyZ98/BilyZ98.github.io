## Basic digital
Transistor to ALU

Transistor to memory

I learn from this video that memory is made of  several gates 
to remember bit information and controls whether to enable write.

Another interesting thing I learn is that 2 dimensions of 
gates are used to reduce number of wires to store same amount of 
information.
