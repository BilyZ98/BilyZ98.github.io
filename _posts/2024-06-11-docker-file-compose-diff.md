## Difference between Dockerfile and Docker Compose 
Dockerfile and Docker Compose are both important components of Docker, but they serve different purposes:

1. **Dockerfile**¹²³⁴⁵:
   - A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image¹²³⁴⁵.
   - It's essentially Docker's version of a Makefile or build.gradle⁵.
   - It includes commands like `RUN`, `ADD`, `COPY`, `ENTRYPOINT`, etc².
   - You build an image from a Dockerfile².
   - An image is a template for running containers, consisting of multiple read-only layers².
   - Dockerfile is used to create a container image².

2. **Docker Compose**¹²³⁴⁵:
   - Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications¹²³⁴⁵.
   - It uses a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to define the services that make up your app so they can be run together in an isolated environment³.
   - A single Compose file can contain multiple container deployment configurations².
   - Docker Compose is used to deploy an instance of that image as a container².
   - It's more readable, more maintainable, more intuitive².

In summary, a Dockerfile is used to build images, while Docker Compose is used to define and run multi-container applications¹²³⁴⁵. The Dockerfile uses the `docker build` command, while the docker-compose.yml file uses the `docker-compose up` command⁴. A docker-compose.yml file can reference a Dockerfile, but a Dockerfile can’t reference a docker-compose file⁴.


## Specify docker image storage location
To specify a different storage location for Docker images, you need to modify Docker's configuration. Here are the steps for Linux and Windows:

**For Linux**¹²:
1. Stop the Docker daemon if it's running. You can do this with the command: `sudo systemctl stop docker`.
2. Create a `daemon.json` file in `/etc/docker/` if it doesn't exist¹.
3. Open the `daemon.json` file and add the following, replacing `"/mnt"` with your desired path¹:

```json
{
  "data-root": "/mnt"
}
```

4. Save and close the file.
5. Start the Docker daemon with the command: `sudo systemctl start docker`.

**For Windows**³:
1. Quit Docker Desktop if it's running.
2. Open the `daemon.json` file located at `C:\ProgramData\Docker\config\`.
3. Add the following to the file, replacing `"D:\\Virtual Machines\\Docker"` with your desired path³:

```json
{
  "data-root": "D:\\Virtual Machines\\Docker"
}
```

4. Save and close the file.
5. Start Docker Desktop.

After making these changes, Docker will store its images in the specified directory. You can confirm the new storage location by running the command `docker info` and checking the `Docker Root Dir` value¹²³. Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to read and write to the specified directory¹²³.
