## Difference between Dockerfile and Docker Compose 
Dockerfile and Docker Compose are both important components of Docker, but they serve different purposes:

1. **Dockerfile**¹²³⁴⁵:
   - A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image¹²³⁴⁵.
   - It's essentially Docker's version of a Makefile or build.gradle⁵.
   - It includes commands like `RUN`, `ADD`, `COPY`, `ENTRYPOINT`, etc².
   - You build an image from a Dockerfile².
   - An image is a template for running containers, consisting of multiple read-only layers².
   - Dockerfile is used to create a container image².

2. **Docker Compose**¹²³⁴⁵:
   - Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications¹²³⁴⁵.
   - It uses a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to define the services that make up your app so they can be run together in an isolated environment³.
   - A single Compose file can contain multiple container deployment configurations².
   - Docker Compose is used to deploy an instance of that image as a container².
   - It's more readable, more maintainable, more intuitive².

In summary, a Dockerfile is used to build images, while Docker Compose is used to define and run multi-container applications¹²³⁴⁵. The Dockerfile uses the `docker build` command, while the docker-compose.yml file uses the `docker-compose up` command⁴. A docker-compose.yml file can reference a Dockerfile, but a Dockerfile can’t reference a docker-compose file⁴.
