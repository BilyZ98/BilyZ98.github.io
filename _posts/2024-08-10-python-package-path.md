I have micrograd2 under micrograd folder but this error shows when I run test.py. how to fix it ?  

File "/home/zt/bilyz_website_new/code/micrograd/test/test.py", line 2, in <module>
    from micrograd2.engine import Value
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'micrograd2'


It looks like Python is unable to find the `micrograd2` module. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check the Directory Structure**: Ensure that the `micrograd2` folder is correctly placed within the `micrograd` directory and that it contains an `__init__.py` file. This file is necessary for Python to recognize the directory as a package.

    ```
    micrograd/
    ├── micrograd2/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── engine.py
    └── test/
        └── test.py
    ```

2. **Update the Import Statement**: If `micrograd2` is a subdirectory of `micrograd`, you might need to adjust your import statement in `test.py` to reflect the correct path. Try changing:
    ```python
    from micrograd2.engine import Value
    ```
    to:
    ```python
    from micrograd.micrograd2.engine import Value
    ```

3. **Check the PYTHONPATH**: Ensure that the `micrograd` directory is included in your `PYTHONPATH`. You can temporarily add it by running:
    ```bash
    export PYTHONPATH=/home/zt/bilyz_website_new/code/micrograd:$PYTHONPATH
    ```

4. **Run the Script from the Correct Directory**: Make sure you are running `test.py` from the `micrograd` directory or adjust your working directory accordingly.
