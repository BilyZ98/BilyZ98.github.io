I first found this slide from a wechat offical account.

Then I found the original link through google.
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/)


What I learn that refreshes my mind is that this talk mentions that

one should do this 

Coming up with research idea -> Writing paper -> Doing research work


instead of this 

Coming up with research idea -> Doing research work -> Writing paper

I felt mind blowing when I first read this.

This make so much sense.


The talk mentions that an  idea is meaningless if you just keep it to yourself.

So what you should do is to write them down and spread your idea to other people
as early as possbile.
