## Program1: generate image with multiple threads.

Hardware:
hyperthreads? 


Code: 
partition the image generation task.


Plot speedup line with number of threads as x axis.

Time for each thread

Not all threads run with same finish time.

## More efficient implementation

cacheline aware ? 

In this code image is divided by `numThreads` blocks and 
each thread with `threadId`   accesses idx:threadId of each block.

This means that it's highly likely that at the same moment each
thread access the same memory block that is in cache.

This is just my understanding.


The reason for some threads taking much longer time to finish the job
is that some adjacent rows need much more time to compute.
If we use round-robin assignment strategy then we can distribute the 
computation job evenly and each thread can get equal amount of computation job.

GPT give me following answer when I asked it why to use round-robin assignment:

Thread 2 has one more row to process than the other threads, which can lead to a slight imbalance. However, the imbalance becomes more pronounced if the work done per row is not uniform. For example, if the computation for the Mandelbrot set is more complex for certain rows, the threads processing those rows will take longer to complete, leading to idle time for other threads.

This imbalance can be avoided by using a better load balancing strategy, such as the round-robin assignment used in the original code, which distributes the rows more evenly across the threads. ðŸ˜Š


```cpp
void workerThreadStart(WorkerArgs * const args) {

  // TODO FOR CS149 STUDENTS: Implement the body of the worker
  // thread here. Each thread should make a call to mandelbrotSerial()
  // to compute a part of the output image.  For example, in a
  // program that uses two threads, thread 0 could compute the top
  // half of the image and thread 1 could compute the bottom half.
  //
  double startTime = CycleTimer::currentSeconds();
  float x0 = args->x0;
  float y0 = args->y0;
  float x1 = args->x1;
  float y1 = args->y1;
  int width = args->width;
  int height = args->height;

  // printf("cur start row: %d, cur total row:%d\n", cur_start_row, cur_total_rows);
  for(int i=0; i < height/args->numThreads; i++) {
    int start_row = args->threadId + i * args->numThreads;
    int num_rows = 1;
    mandelbrotSerial(x0, y0, x1, y1,
                     width, height,
                     start_row, num_rows,
                     args->maxIterations, args->output);


  }
  double endTime = CycleTimer::currentSeconds();
  double exe_time = endTime - startTime;
  printf("exe time: %f ms\n", exe_time*1000);


  // printf("Hello world from thread %d\n", args->threadId);
}
```
