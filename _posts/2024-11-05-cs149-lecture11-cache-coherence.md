## Lecture 11: Cache coherence


Cache takes large amount of area in the chip

Cache bring performance boosting.

Two locality of data access pattern so that cache can help with 
performance.
1. Spatial locality
2. Temporal locality

Cache and cacheline in cpu.
Usually a single cacheline contains multiple
cache bytes(64bytes which can store 8 int for example ).
