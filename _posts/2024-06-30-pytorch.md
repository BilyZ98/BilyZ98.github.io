## Move tensor to cuda with different name returned
Question:
can I still use model to do training when I have following code ? 
In this code, I assign m to tensor on cuda. But I am not sure whether I can still use model to do back propagation 
```python
model = BigramLanguageModel()
m = model.to(device)

```


Yes, you can still use the `model` for training and backpropagation. When you do `m = model.to(device)`, it doesn't create a new model. Instead, it moves the `model` to the specified `device` (which is presumably a CUDA device in your case) and returns a reference to the same model. So, `m` and `model` are actually the same model, just accessed through different names.

Here's an example of how you might use it:

```python
model = BigramLanguageModel()
model = model.to(device)  # move model to device

# define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

# training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(dataloader):
        inputs, targets = inputs.to(device), targets.to(device)

        # forward pass
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)

        # backward pass and optimization
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

In this code, `model` is used for both the forward pass and the backward pass, and it works correctly because `model` and `m` are the same model. The key point is that the model parameters need to be on the same device as the data and targets when you perform the forward and backward passes. That's why `inputs` and `targets` are also moved to `device` before the forward pass. 

So, in your case, you can continue to use `model` in your code for training and backpropagation, even after calling `model.to(device)`. Just make sure to move your inputs and targets to the same device before you use them with your model. If you want to use `m` instead of `model` after the `to(device)` call, that's fine too. It's really just a matter of which name you prefer to use. They both refer to the same underlying model.

### Difference between `model.to(device)` and `model.cuda()`
The `.to()` method and `.cuda()` are both used to move PyTorch tensors to a specific device (CPU or GPU), but they have some differences:

1. **`.to(device)`**:
   - The `.to()` method is more general and versatile. It allows you to move a tensor to any specified device (CPU or a specific GPU).
   - You can pass either a string (e.g., `"cuda"` or `"cpu"`) or a specific device (e.g., `torch.device("cuda:0")`) as an argument.
   - Example:
     ```python
     tensor.to("cuda")  # Move tensor to the first available GPU (if available)
     tensor.to(torch.device("cuda:1"))  # Move tensor to the second GPU (if available)
     ```

2. **`.cuda()`**:
   - The `.cuda()` method is specifically for moving tensors to a GPU (CUDA device).
   - It is a shorthand for `.to("cuda")`.
   - If you call `.cuda()` without any arguments, it will move the tensor to the first available GPU (if any). If no GPUs are available, it will raise an error.
   - Example:
     ```python
     tensor.cuda()  # Move tensor to the first available GPU (if available)
     ```
