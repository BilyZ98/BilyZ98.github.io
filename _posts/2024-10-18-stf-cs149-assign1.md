## More efficient implementation

cacheline aware ? 

In this code image is divided by `numThreads` blocks and 
each thread with `threadId`   accesses idx:threadId of each block.

This means that it's highly likely that at the same moment each
thread access the same memory block that is in cache.

This is just my understanding.


The reason for some threads taking much longer time to finish the job
is that some adjacent rows need much more time to compute.
If we use round-robin assignment strategy then we can distribute the 
computation job evenly and each thread can get equal amount of computation job.

GPT give me following answer when I asked it why to use round-robin assignment:

Thread 2 has one more row to process than the other threads, which can lead to a slight imbalance. However, the imbalance becomes more pronounced if the work done per row is not uniform. For example, if the computation for the Mandelbrot set is more complex for certain rows, the threads processing those rows will take longer to complete, leading to idle time for other threads.

This imbalance can be avoided by using a better load balancing strategy, such as the round-robin assignment used in the original code, which distributes the rows more evenly across the threads. ðŸ˜Š


```cpp
void workerThreadStart(WorkerArgs * const args) {

  // TODO FOR CS149 STUDENTS: Implement the body of the worker
  // thread here. Each thread should make a call to mandelbrotSerial()
  // to compute a part of the output image.  For example, in a
  // program that uses two threads, thread 0 could compute the top
  // half of the image and thread 1 could compute the bottom half.
  //
  double startTime = CycleTimer::currentSeconds();
  float x0 = args->x0;
  float y0 = args->y0;
  float x1 = args->x1;
  float y1 = args->y1;
  int width = args->width;
  int height = args->height;

  // printf("cur start row: %d, cur total row:%d\n", cur_start_row, cur_total_rows);
  for(int i=0; i < height/args->numThreads; i++) {
    int start_row = args->threadId + i * args->numThreads;
    int num_rows = 1;
    mandelbrotSerial(x0, y0, x1, y1,
                     width, height,
                     start_row, num_rows,
                     args->maxIterations, args->output);


  }
  double endTime = CycleTimer::currentSeconds();
  double exe_time = endTime - startTime;
  printf("exe time: %f ms\n", exe_time*1000);


  // printf("Hello world from thread %d\n", args->threadId);
}

## Prog2: Vectorizing  code using SIMD intrinsics

[Assignment link](https://github.com/stanford-cs149/asst1?tab=readme-ov-file#program-2-vectorizing-code-using-simd-intrinsics-20-points)

Solution idea:

Just translate the `clampedExpSerial` the code to use SIMD.
Refer to this `absVector` and `absSerial` to see how translation works.


To deal with situation that total number of loop iterations is 
not a multiple of SIMD vector width we can 
set `maskAll` at the beginning of the function so that 
only valid values of input vector is used for SIMD computation.
```cpp
    if(i + VECTOR_WIDTH > N) {
      maskAll = _cs149_init_ones(remain_count);
    } else {
      maskAll = _cs149_init_ones();
    }

```

code:
```cpp
void clampedExpVector(float* values, int* exponents, float* output, int N) {

  //
  // CS149 STUDENTS TODO: Implement your vectorized version of
  // clampedExpSerial() here.
  //
  // Your solution should work for any value of
  // N and VECTOR_WIDTH, not just when VECTOR_WIDTH divides N
  //
  
  __cs149_vec_float x;
  __cs149_vec_int   y_exponents;
  __cs149_vec_float result;
  __cs149_vec_int zeros_int = _cs149_vset_int(0);
  __cs149_vec_int ones_int = _cs149_vset_int(1);
  __cs149_vec_float ones_float = _cs149_vset_float(1.0f);
  __cs149_mask maskAll, maskExponentIsZero, maskExponentNotZero;  
  int remain_count = N % VECTOR_WIDTH;
  // int first_valid_count = remain_count > 0 ? VECTOR_WIDTH - remain_count : VECTOR_WIDTH;
  for(int i=0; i < N; i+= VECTOR_WIDTH) {
    if(i + VECTOR_WIDTH > N) {
      maskAll = _cs149_init_ones(remain_count);
    } else {
      maskAll = _cs149_init_ones();
    }
    // CS149Logger.addLog("initones", maskAll, VECTOR_WIDTH);

    maskExponentIsZero = _cs149_init_ones(0);

    _cs149_vload_float(x, values+i, maskAll);
    _cs149_vload_int(y_exponents, exponents+i, maskAll);

    // if y== 0
    _cs149_veq_int(maskExponentIsZero, y_exponents, zeros_int, maskAll);
    maskExponentNotZero = _cs149_mask_not(maskExponentIsZero);

    // x == 1  if y_exponents == 0
    //
    _cs149_vmove_float(result, ones_float, maskExponentIsZero);      

    // else 
    // result = x;
    _cs149_vmove_float(result, x, maskExponentNotZero);
    // count = y -1;
    _cs149_vsub_int(y_exponents, y_exponents, ones_int, maskExponentNotZero);
    __cs149_mask maskExpNotZeroCnt;
    _cs149_vgt_int(maskExpNotZeroCnt, y_exponents,  zeros_int, maskAll);
    // while (count > 0)
    // result *= x ;
    // count--;
    while(_cs149_cntbits(maskExpNotZeroCnt)) {
      _cs149_vmult_float(result, result, x, maskExpNotZeroCnt);

      _cs149_vsub_int(y_exponents, y_exponents, ones_int, maskExponentNotZero);
      _cs149_vgt_int(maskExpNotZeroCnt, y_exponents,  zeros_int, maskAll);
    }


    // if( result > 9.999999f) {
    // result = 9.999999f;
    // }
    __cs149_mask mask_gt_9;
    __cs149_vec_float nine_float = _cs149_vset_float(9.999999f);
    _cs149_vgt_float(mask_gt_9, result,  nine_float, maskAll);
    _cs149_vmove_float(result, nine_float, mask_gt_9);

    // output[i] = result;
    _cs149_vstore_float(output + i, result, maskAll);

    
  }
}
```



Run ./myexp -s 10000 and sweep the vector width from 2, 4, 8, to 16. Record the resulting vector utilization. You can do this by changing the #define VECTOR_WIDTH value in CS149intrin.h. Does the vector utilization increase, decrease or stay the same as VECTOR_WIDTH changes? Why?

Answer: 
The vector utilization decrease as `VECTOR_WIDTH` increases.
The reason I think it's that not all values in vector is used for computation as 
`VECTOR_WIDTH` increases.

So it's not a very good idea to have very large `VECTOR_WIDTH`?

## Difference between launch and foreach in ISPC 

TLDR; both `launch` and `foreach` can do task parallelism. But 
`foreach` can use SIMD and `launch` can not do that itself.

The difference between `launch` and `foreach` in ISPC lies in the type of parallelism they express and how they are used:

- **`launch`**: This keyword is used to create a task that runs independently. When you use `launch`, you're telling ISPC to execute a function asynchronously, potentially on a different core. This is useful for task parallelism, where you have separate tasks that can run concurrently. For example:
  ```c
  launch myFunction();
  ```
  This will execute `myFunction` as a separate task.

- **`foreach`**: This construct is used for data parallelism, where the same operation is applied to multiple data elements in parallel. The `foreach` loop allows ISPC to execute iterations in parallel, utilizing SIMD vector units. For example:
  ```c
  foreach (i = 0 ... N) {
      // loop body
  }
  ```
  This will execute the loop body in parallel for each value of `i` from `0` to `N-1`.

In summary, `launch` is used for task parallelism to run independent tasks concurrently, while `foreach` is used for data parallelism to apply the same operation to multiple data elements in parallel. Both constructs help you write parallel code, but they are suited for different types of parallelism. ðŸ˜Š

 The `launch` construct in ISPC is primarily designed for task parallelism, which means it can run tasks in parallel on multiple cores. However, `launch` itself does not directly utilize SIMD parallelism. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:
- **`launch`**: When you use `launch`, ISPC creates a new task that can run concurrently with other tasks. These tasks can be scheduled on different CPU cores, allowing for parallel execution. The focus of `launch` is on task-level parallelism, not on vectorization or SIMD parallelism.

- **`foreach`**: On the other hand, `foreach` is designed for data parallelism and can utilize both SIMD and multi-core parallelism. It vectorizes the loop to use SIMD instructions and also distributes the iterations across multiple cores.

While `launch` does not directly use SIMD, the tasks that are launched can themselves contain `foreach` loops or other code that uses SIMD parallelism. So, you can combine `launch` and `foreach` to achieve a mix of task parallelism and data parallelism. For example:
```c
void taskFunction(float* data, int N) {
    foreach (i = 0 ... N) {
        data[i] = data[i] * 2.0f;
    }
}

launch taskFunction(data, N);
```
In this example, `taskFunction` uses `foreach` to process data in parallel using SIMD, and `launch` runs `taskFunction` as a separate task on a different core.

Would you like to explore more about how to effectively combine `launch` and `foreach` in ISPC, or have any other questions? ðŸ˜Š

## Change values array to change speed up of sqrt 
The best case is that all simd vectors handles the same value.
And we would get max speed up if each SIMD vector takes long time to finish 
which reduce the percentage of sync and communication/ scheduling overhead
brought by ispc.

Extra Credit: (1 point) Note that the total memory bandwidth consumed computation in main.cpp is TOTAL_BYTES = 4 * N * sizeof(float);. Even though saxpy loads one element from X, one element from Y, and writes one element to result the multiplier by 4 is correct. Why is this the case? (Hint, think about how CPU caches work.)

Answer:
It's because saxpy fetch 4 vector variables through the memory.
```cpp
void saxpySerial(int N,
                       float scale,
                       float X[],
                       float Y[],
                       float result[])
{

    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {
        result[i] = scale * X[i] + Y[i];
    }
}

```


Extra Credit: (points handled on a case-by-case basis) Improve the performance of saxpy. We're looking for a significant speedup here, not just a few percentage points. If successful, describe how you did it and what a best-possible implementation on these systems might achieve. Also, if successful, come tell the staff, we'll be interested. ;-)

Answer: 
I don't know how to do that.
