For each paper I will give a brief summary and my thoughts on it.
I will link each paper to other related papers if possible.
Besides, I might add code and related resources if I have time.


For most papers I will first read titles and abstract to 
decide whether I should read the rest part of the paper. 
This helps me to quickly filter out papers that are interesting to me.


So for majority of papers I will make the summary short. 
For others that are interesting to me, I will  write a longer summary.

Summary: 
This papers studies llm traning job workload in datacenter.
It releases job traces in datacenter for training llm.
It mentions that gpu take 65% of power usage.

I didn't find any other interesting contribution from this paper 
other than the job traces. So I won't spend more time reading this paper.
