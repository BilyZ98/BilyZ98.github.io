This is achieved through RDMA’s one-sided verbs, which allow for operations like read and write to be performed directly on the remote memory.</p> <h3 id="key-features-of-single-sided-rdma">Key Features of Single-Sided RDMA:</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Low Latency</strong>: Provides ultra-low latency network communication.</li> <li> <strong>CPU Bypass</strong>: Bypasses the remote CPU, reducing overhead and improving efficiency.</li> <li> <strong>Direct Memory Access</strong>: Enables direct access to remote memory, which is particularly useful in distributed systems and databases.</li> </ul> <h3 id="applications">Applications:</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Distributed Databases</strong>: Used in disaggregated database management systems to improve performance and scalability.</li> <li> <strong>Key-Value Stores</strong>: Utilized in high-performance key-value stores to achieve low latency and high throughput.</li> </ul> <p>Single-sided RDMA is a powerful tool for building efficient and scalable distributed systems by leveraging direct memory access and minimizing CPU involvement.</p> <h2 id="what-is-two-sided-rdma">What is two-sided RDMA</h2> <p>Yes, there is a concept known as two-sided RDMA operations. While single-sided RDMA operations involve one machine directly accessing the memory of another without involving the remote CPU, two-sided RDMA operations require both the sender and receiver to participate in the communication.</p> <h3 id="key-features-of-two-sided-rdma">Key Features of Two-Sided RDMA:</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Send/Receive Operations</strong>: In two-sided RDMA, the sender posts a send work request, and the receiver posts a receive work request. The data transfer occurs when the send request matches the receive request.</li> <li> <strong>CPU Involvement</strong>: Both the sender’s and receiver’s CPUs are involved in the communication process, which can add some overhead compared to single-sided operations.</li> <li> <strong>Use Cases</strong>: Two-sided RDMA is often used in scenarios where synchronization between the sender and receiver is necessary, such as in certain types of distributed transactions and message passing.</li> </ul> <h3 id="comparison-with-single-sided-rdma">Comparison with Single-Sided RDMA:</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Performance</strong>: Single-sided RDMA generally offers lower latency and higher throughput because it bypasses the remote CPU. However, two-sided RDMA can be more suitable for applications requiring tight synchronization and coordination between nodes.</li> <li> <strong>Complexity</strong>: Two-sided RDMA operations can be more complex to implement due to the need for both sides to coordinate their actions.</li> </ul> <p>You can find more detailed information and comparisons between one-sided and two-sided RDMA operations <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/comparasion-of-one-sided-vs-two-sided-operations/207183" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> </body></html>
